# Breast-Cancer-Classification-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
This project uses **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** to classify tumors as benign or malignant. Models were evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** to identify the best performer.


Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases affecting millions worldwide. Early and accurate detection is critical for improving treatment outcomes and increasing survival rates. This project explores the use of five widely used machine learning classification algorithms—**Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**—to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign.  

The dataset used in this study comes from the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, which includes key diagnostic attributes such as tumor size, cell shape, and texture. Each algorithm was carefully implemented, trained, and evaluated using performance metrics including **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Support**. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of each model's effectiveness in predicting tumor classifications.  

Key steps in the project include **data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and comparison of results**. The performance of each algorithm was compared to identify the most accurate and reliable model. Insights drawn from precision, recall, and F1-scores allowed for a deeper understanding of how well each model performed across different tumor types.  

Visualizations, including confusion matrices and ROC curves, were incorporated to demonstrate model performance and decision boundaries. The results reveal that while all five models show promising performance, some algorithms outperform others in terms of accuracy and generalization capability.  

This project serves as a foundation for understanding the practical application of machine learning in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and classification. It highlights the importance of model selection, performance evaluation, and data-driven decision-making in building robust predictive systems.  

By making this project open-source, it aims to contribute to ongoing research in medical data analysis and provide a reference for students, researchers, and data science enthusiasts looking to explore machine learning applications in healthcare.
